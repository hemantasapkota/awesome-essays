The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything.  The
number 42 is, in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams, the
"Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything",
calculated by an enormous supercomputer named Deep Thought over a period of 7.5
million years. Unfortunately, no one knows what the question is. Thus, to
calculate the Ultimate Question, a special computer the size of a small planet
was built from organic components and named "Earth". The Ultimate Question "What
do you get when you multiply six by nine"[17] was found by Arthur Dent and Ford
Prefect in the second book of the series, The Restaurant at the End of the
Universe. This appeared first in the radio play and later in the novelization of
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The fact that Adams named the episodes of
the radio play "fits", the same archaic title for a chapter or section used by
Lewis Carroll in "The Hunting of the Snark", suggests that Adams was influenced
by Carroll's fascination with and frequent use of the number. The fourth book in
the series, the novel So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish, contains 42
chapters. According to the novel Mostly Harmless, 42 is the street address of
Stavromula Beta. In 1994 Adams created the 42 Puzzle, a game based on the number
42.

The 2011 book 42: Douglas Adams' Amazingly Accurate Answer to Life, the Universe
and Everything[18] examines Adams' choice of the number 42 and also contains a
compendium of some instances of the number in science, popular culture, and
humour.
